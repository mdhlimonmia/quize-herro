    <h1>1.What is difference between map(), filter(), forEach() and find()?</h1>
    <h3>The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.
        It's executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        <ul>
            <li>loops through each element in array.</li>
            <li>calls the provided function for each element.</li>
            <li>creates a new array.</li>
            <li>doesn’t alter the original array.</li>
            <li>return a array.</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The filter() method creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the callback() function.
        <ul>
            <li>The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.</li>
            <li>The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.</li>
            <li>The filter() method does not change the original array.</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
        <ul>
            <li>Just about anything you can do with forEach()</li>
            <li>forEach() throws away return values and always returns undefined</li>
            <li>forEach() will allow a callback function to mutate the current array.</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
        <ul>
            <li>If you need the index of the found element in the array, use findIndex().</li>
            <li>find() returns the element itself that satisfies the condition.</li>
            <li>find(), as soon as the element that satisfies the condition is found, it gets returned.</li>
            <li> find() helps to avoid iterating over the 3rd object in the array.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>3.What is event loop?</h1>
        <h2>The event loop:</h2>
        <h3>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.</h3>
        <h3>
            <ol>
            There are two main aspects to consider when the JavaScript Engine reads and executes our code:
                <li>We need a place to store and write information (variables, functions, etc.)</li>
                <li>We need to keep track of what’s happening to our code line by line.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                Order of operations:
                <li>When calling bar, a first frame is created containing references to bar's arguments and local variables.</li>
                <li>When bar calls foo, a second frame is created and pushed on top of the first one, containing references to foo's arguments and local variables.</li>
                <li>When foo returns, the top frame element is popped out of the stack (leaving only bar's call frame).</li>
                <li>When bar returns, the stack is empty.</li>
            </ul>
